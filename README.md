# RepoSense - Gemini-Powered Code Intelligence

**RepoSense** is a next-generation AI developer tool that analyzes GitHub repositories to provide deep, system-level insights, architecture diagrams, and risk assessments. It is powered by the **Google Gemini 3** model.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Deep System Analysis**: Understand project purpose, target users, and core problems solved.
*   **Architecture Visualization**: ASCII-based architectural diagrams generated by AI.
*   **Risk Assessment**: Identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and scalability issues.
*   **Component Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of key files and modules.
*   **Clean UI**: Modern, responsive interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

## 🔑 Getting the Gemini API Key

1.  **Go to Google AI Studio**: Visit [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Sign in**: Use your Google account.
3.  **Create Key**: Click the blue **"Create API key"** button.
    *   You can create a key in a new project (recommended) or an existing Google Cloud project.
4.  **Copy**: Copy the generated API Key string (it starts with `AIza...`).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
*   **npm** or **yarn**
*   **Google Gemini API Key**: Follow the steps above to obtain one.

## 📥 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thamothara7/RepoSense
    cd RepoSense
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
    *   Add your Gemini API Key:
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

## 🏃 Running Locally

Because this project uses Serverless Functions (`api/analyze.ts`) to secure your API key, you must use the **Vercel CLI** to run it locally. The standard `npm run dev` will only load the frontend and API calls will fail.

1.  **Start the development environment:**
    ```bash
    npx vercel dev
    ```
    *(If prompted, follow the instructions to link to a Vercel project. You can choose "No" to existing project to set up a new one).*

2.  Open your browser to the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## 🚢 Deployment (Vercel)

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel using **Serverless Functions** to keep your API key secure.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import to Vercel**:
    *   Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
    *   Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    *   Select your `reposense` repository.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   In the "Environment Variables" section of the Vercel deployment screen:
    *   **Key**: `API_KEY`
    *   **Value**: Paste your key starting with `AIza...`
    *   Click **Add**.
4.  **Deploy**: Click "Deploy".

> **Security Note**: RepoSense uses a Vercel Serverless Function (`api/analyze.ts`) to proxy requests to Google. Your API Key is **never** exposed to the browser client.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API Key is missing"
*   **Locally**: Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root with `API_KEY=...`. Restart the server (`npx vercel dev`) after creating it.
*   **Vercel**: Go to Project Settings -> Environment Variables and ensure `API_KEY` is set. You must redeploy (Deployment -> Redeploy) after adding the key.

### "Gemini API rate limit exceeded"
*   The application uses the Gemini 3 Pro model by default. If you hit the rate limit, the app automatically retries using the faster "Flash" model.
*   If you continue to see this error, wait 1-2 minutes and try again.
*   Consider upgrading to a paid tier in Google AI Studio if you need higher limits.

### "Analysis timed out"
*   Vercel Serverless Functions have a 10-second timeout on the Hobby (free) plan.
*   If analyzing a large repo with "Deep Reasoning" enabled, it may hit this limit. Try disabling "Deep Reasoning" or upgrading your Vercel plan to Pro (which allows up to 60s timeouts).
