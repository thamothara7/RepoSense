# RepoSense

RepoSense is a next-generation AI developer tool that analyzes GitHub repositories to provide deep, system-level insights, architecture diagrams, and risk assessments.

It is powered by the Google Gemini 3 model and runs entirely in the browser, ensuring low latency and high privacy.

## Features

*   **Deep System Analysis**: Understand project purpose, target users, and core problems solved.
*   **Architecture Visualization**: ASCII-based architectural diagrams generated by AI.
*   **Risk Assessment**: Identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and scalability issues.
*   **Component Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of key files and modules.
*   **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: Securely use your own Gemini API Key directly in the browser. Keys are stored locally and never sent to a backend server.
*   **Dark/Light Mode**: Beautiful, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.

## Getting a Gemini API Key

To use RepoSense, you need a Google Gemini API Key.

1.  **Go to Google AI Studio**: Visit https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2.  **Sign in**: Use your Google account.
3.  **Create Key**: Click the "Create API key" button.
4.  **Copy**: Copy the generated API Key string (it starts with AIza).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thamothara7/RepoSense
    cd RepoSense
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Building for Production

Since RepoSense is a client-side application (SPA), you can build it as a static site.

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory. You can deploy this folder to any static hosting provider like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or Vercel.

## Security and Privacy

RepoSense is designed with security in mind:

*   **Client-Side Execution**: All analysis happens directly in your browser.
*   **Secure Key Storage**: Your API Key is stored in your browser's localStorage for your convenience.
*   **Direct Connection**: The application connects directly to Google's Gemini API. Your key and data are never sent to any intermediate backend server or third-party database.

## Troubleshooting

### Gemini API rate limit exceeded
*   The application uses the Gemini 3 Pro/Flash models. If you hit the rate limit, wait 1-2 minutes and try again.
*   Ensure you have a valid API Key configured in the Settings menu.

### Repository not found
*   Ensure the repository is public. RepoSense cannot access private repositories without a Personal Access Token (PAT).
*   You can add a GitHub PAT in the Settings menu to increase rate limits and access private repos (if your token has permissions).
