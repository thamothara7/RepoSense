# RepoSense - Gemini-Powered Code Intelligence

**RepoSense** is a next-generation AI developer tool that analyzes GitHub repositories to provide deep, system-level insights, architecture diagrams, and risk assessments. It is powered by the **Google Gemini 3** model.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Deep System Analysis**: Understand project purpose, target users, and core problems solved.
*   **Architecture Visualization**: ASCII-based architectural diagrams generated by AI.
*   **Risk Assessment**: Identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and scalability issues.
*   **Component Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of key files and modules.
*   **Clean UI**: Modern, responsive interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
*   **npm** or **yarn**
*   **Google Gemini API Key**: You need a paid or free tier API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## 📥 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thamothara7/RepoSense
    cd RepoSense
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
    *   Add your Gemini API Key:
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

## 🏃 Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🚢 Deployment (Vercel)

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import to Vercel**:
    *   Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
    *   Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    *   Select your `reposense` repository.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   In the "Environment Variables" section of the Vercel deployment screen:
    *   **Key**: `API_KEY`
    *   **Value**: `your_actual_google_gemini_key`
    *   Click **Add**.
4.  **Deploy**: Click "Deploy".

### ⚠️ Important Note on API Keys
Since this is a client-side application, the API Key is embedded in the frontend build. 
*   **For Personal/Demo Use**: This is acceptable if you trust your users or restrict access.
*   **For Production**: It is recommended to move the API call to a backend proxy (e.g., Vercel Serverless Functions) to keep your API key hidden from the browser.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API Key is missing"
*   **Locally**: Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root with `API_KEY=...`. Restart the dev server (`npm run dev`) after creating it.
*   **Vercel**: Go to Project Settings -> Environment Variables and ensure `API_KEY` is set. You must redeploy (Deployment -> Redeploy) after adding the key.

### "Gemini API rate limit exceeded"
*   The application uses the Gemini 3 Pro model by default. If you hit the rate limit, the app automatically retries using the faster "Flash" model.
*   If you continue to see this error, wait 1-2 minutes and try again.
*   Consider upgrading to a paid tier in Google AI Studio if you need higher limits.

### "Blue/Blank Screen on Load"
*   Open the browser Developer Tools (F12) -> Console.
*   If you see "React is not defined" or version mismatch errors, ensure you are not using conflicting `importmap` scripts in `index.html`. The standard `vite build` handles React bundling.
